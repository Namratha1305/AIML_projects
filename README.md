**Foundational AI/ML Projects - BEL CRL Internship**
This repository contains a collection of foundational Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) projects developed during my internship at the Central Research Laboratory (CRL) of Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bengaluru. The primary goal of these projects was to build practical, hands-on skills in core areas of computer vision and predictive modeling.

**Key Projects & Learnings**
This repository is organized into several key modules, each focusing on a different fundamental concept in AI/ML.

1. Computer Vision: Image Masking
Objective: To learn fundamental image processing techniques for isolating specific regions of interest (ROI) within an image.

Description: Developed Python scripts using OpenCV and NumPy to apply masks to images. This was implemented for both grayscale and RGB color spaces, demonstrating the ability to manipulate image channels and perform binary operations to selectively hide or reveal parts of an image.

Skills Gained: Image manipulation, color space conversion (RGB to Grayscale), binary masking, and array manipulation with NumPy.

2. Neural Networks: XOR Prediction
Objective: To build a simple neural network from scratch to understand the core mechanics of model training and prediction.

Description: Implemented a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow to solve the classic XOR problem. The model was trained to learn the non-linear relationship in the XOR logic gate and predict the correct output (0 or 1) for a given binary input. This involved setting up the network architecture, defining activation functions, and training the model.

Skills Gained: Neural network architecture, activation functions, backpropagation concepts, model training, and prediction with TensorFlow.

3. Predictive Modeling: Time Series Forecasting
Objective: To apply machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast future values based on historical time-ordered data.

Description: Utilized libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas to build a time series prediction model. The project involved loading and preprocessing sequential data, training a model to recognize patterns, and using it to make future predictions.

Skills Gained: Data preprocessing, feature engineering for time series, model training with Scikit-learn, and predictive analysis.
